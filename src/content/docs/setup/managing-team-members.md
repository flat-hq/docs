### Inviting a team member

To invite a new team member, just click _Add people_ in the sidebar and enter their email address. They'll receive an invitation email with a link to sign up for Flat and join your organization. You can also invite them from the [_Admin Settings | People_](https://go.flat.app/settings/people) section.

An invited user will appear in the [_Admin Settings | People_](https://go.flat.app/settings/people) section as _pending_ until they sign up. If they lose the invitation or it expires, you can click the dropdown menu next to their name to resend them their invitation.

### Managing roles and access control

To change a team member's role, visit [_Admin Settings | People_](https://go.flat.app/settings/people) and choose a role from the menu.

Flat has three user roles:

* **Admin:** Admins have full access to all of the public workspaces in your organization. In addition, they can perform administrative functions like managing your organization's users, integrations, and billing plan.
* **Member:** Member is the default role for Flat users. Members have full access to all of the public workspaces in your organization, but they can't do any administrative functions.
* **Guest:** Guests can only access the workspaces to which they've been explicitly added. Within those workspaces, they have full access just like a Member. They're not able to view or edit any other workspaces.

### Deactivating a team member

To deactivate a team member, visit [_Admin Settings | People_](https://go.flat.app/settings/people) and click the dropdown menu next to their name.

When a user is deactivated, they'll no longer be able to access your organization. However, their past comments and other activity in Flat will still be visible to your team.

### Reactivating team members

To reactivate a previously deactivated team member, visit [_Admin Settings | People_](https://go.flat.app/settings/people) and click the dropdown menu next to their name.

When a user is reactivated, they'll immediately regain access to your organization.
