# Personal planner

## Overview

When you have topics assigned to you in more than one workspace, you’ll likely want a way to see and prioritize everything on your plate in one place.

Flat's **personal planner** is a view that makes it easy to see and organize all of your own work. In your planner, you'll see every topic that you’re the owner of or a collaborator on. More than that, you can prioritize your work by moving topics from the _Inbox_ (where they initially appear when assigned) into one of three simple priority buckets called _Now_, _Next_, and _Later_. Topics disappear from your planner when they’re completed.

**Tip:** Flat lets everyone see each other’s plans by default, so managers can check in on their team members’ prioritizations without having to bother them.
