# Loom

## Overview

Flat's [Loom](https://loom.com/) integration lets you embed Loom videos directly into topics and comments for easier reference. A short video is often a faster and more effective way to collaborate versus text, like explaining how to reproduce a bug or sharing feedback on a design or deploy preview.

## Step-by-step

### Setting up the integration

There's no setup required. Flat automatically detects Loom URLs and displays the videos as embedded content.

### Embedding a Loom video

In the [topic description or comment editor](../topics/topic-descriptions.md), just paste a URL to a Loom video. Flat automatically displays it as embedded content.
