# Discord

## Overview

Flat's [Discord](https://discord.com/) integration lets you receive real-time notifications in Discord when a teammate mentions you in a comment, makes you the owner of a topic, changes a topic that you own, and more.

## Step-by-step

### Setting up the integration

To set up the Discord integration, visit [_Admin Settings | Integrations_](https://go.flat.app/settings/integrations) and click _Connect Discord_. You'll be redirected to Discord, where you can add the Flat bot to your Discord server.

If you have access to more than one Discord server, take a moment to ensure you pick the right one.

The _Admin Settings_ section is only visible to team members with the **Admin** role.
{% endhint %}

### Receiving notifications in Discord

To enable Discord notifications after setting up the integration, visit [_Personal Settings | Notifications_](https://go.flat.app/settings/notifications) and toggle your preference.

Flat will send you real-time notifications for all events in Flat that affect you, such as:

* When a teammate mentions you in a comment, assigns you a blocker, requests your follow-up on a thread, or makes you the owner of or a collaborator on a topic.
* When a teammate changes a topic that you own, collaborate on, or have subscribed to notifications for.

{% hint style="info" %}
Notifications are sent in a private DM channel between you and Flat, not a shared team channel.
{% endhint %}

### Removing the integration

To remove the Discord integration, visit [_Admin Settings | Integrations_](https://go.flat.app/settings/integrations) and click _Disconnect Discord_. You should also visit your Discord server's settings section and remove the Flat bot from your server.
