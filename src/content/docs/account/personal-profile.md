# Personal profile

## Overview

You can set up your personal profile in your Flat organization by clicking your avatar in the upper right corner and choosing _Settings_, then visiting the [_Personal Settings | Profile_](https://go.flat.app/settings/profile) section.

Your personal profile consists of a few items:

* **Display name:** Your display name is your handle within your Flat organization. It's how you'll be displayed on topics you own, comments you author, and topic threads you're assigned. It's also how teammates will `@mention` you.
* **Full name:** You can optionally provide your full name to make it easier for teammates to `@mention` you.
* **Email address:** Your email address is how you sign in to Flat and where you'll receive [email notifications](notifications.md#email).

**For software engineering teams:** You can also provide your GitHub username so that pending review requests and other GitHub activity will appear in Flat using your Flat display name.

## Step-by-step

### Changing your display name

To change your display name, visit [_Personal Settings | Profile_](https://go.flat.app/settings/profile).

We recommend using your first name as your display name, or whatever name you usually go by when talking with your team. That'll make it easier for your teammates to find and recognize you in Flat.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your display name must be unique within your organization.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can change your display name at any time. All of your topics, comments, activity, and `@mentions` will still be associated with you.
{% endhint %}

### Providing your full name

To provide your full name, visit [_Personal Settings | Profile_](https://go.flat.app/settings/profile).

Providing your full name makes it easier for teammates to `@mention` you and ensures we address you correctly if we ever need to contact you about your account.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if your name is "John Smith" and your display name is "John", teammates will still be able to `@mention` you by typing `@smith`. That can be useful if some teammates tend to call you by your first name while others tend to call you by your last name.

### Changing your email address

To change your email address, visit [_Personal Settings | Profile_](https://go.flat.app/settings/profile).

### Setting your GitHub username

To set your GitHub username, visit [_Personal Settings | Profile_](https://go.flat.app/settings/profile) and follow the OAuth prompts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A team **Admin** must also [enable Flat's GitHub integration](../integrations/github.md) for GitHub activity to appear in Flat.
