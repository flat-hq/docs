# Selecting and editing topics

## Overview

Flat's _Quick edit_ feature lets you easily make light edits to a topic, like attaching a label or changing the owner, without leaving the workspace view. You can even select and change multiple topics at the same time!

You can launch _Quick edit_ while viewing a workspace using the keyboard shortcut <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`E`</mark> or by holding <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Shift`</mark>, then clicking on a topic's card. Then, just type what you want to change in the input box — like a label name, user's name, due date, or anything else — and Flat will offer suggested edits that you can apply.

## Step-by-step

{% hint style="info" %}
Flat will only suggest changing the title if you've selected one topic, since if you've selected more than one, it doesn't make sense to give them all the same title!
