# Labels

## Overview

Labels are a flexible and lightweight way to categorize or decorate your topics. A topic can have as many labels as you like, or no labels at all.

Labeling topics can help you and your teammates quickly get a sense of what a topic is about. They can also help you find topics you're looking for because they're included when you [filter a workspace](../finding-and-organizing-topics/workspace-filter.md) or [search for topics](../finding-and-organizing-topics/search-and-history.md).

## Step-by-step

### Creating a label

To create a label, visit any topic's page or start [creating a new topic](creating.md) and open the label picker dropdown by clicking _+ Labels_. Type in the text for the new label. It will automatically be assigned a color and attached to the topic. You can change the color afterward by [editing the label](labels.md#editing-a-label).

Labels can contain spaces, but we recommend keeping them short so they're quick to read and recognize.
{% endhint %}

### Attaching/detaching labels

To attach or detach a label on a topic:

* _While on the topic's page:_ Open the label picker dropdown by clicking _+ Labels_, then click the label you want to attach or detach. You can attach as many labels as you want to the same topic.
* _While in the workspace:_ Use [_Quick edit_](selecting-and-editing-topics.md).

You can also attach labels to new topics as you're creating them [from a workspace](creating.md#creating-in-board-view) or via the [dialog for creating new topics](creating.md#creating-via-the-new-topic-dialog).

### Editing or deleting a label

To edit or delete a label, visit any topic's page or start [creating a new topic](creating.md) and open the label picker dropdown by clicking _+ Labels_, then click the pencil icon next to the label. A dialog will open where you can delete the label or edit its text or color.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you delete a label, it won't be available to attach to topics going forward. However, it will remain attached to topics it was already attached to. That way, you can still [filter](../finding-and-organizing-topics/workspace-filter.md) and [search](../finding-and-organizing-topics/search-and-history.md) for those topics by label.
