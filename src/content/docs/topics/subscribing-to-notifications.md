# Subscribing to notifications

## Overview

You can subscribe to notifications on a topic to keep you aware of changes, even if you're not the topic owner or a collaborator. Use it when you want to know about what happens on a topic even if you're not directly involved with the work.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll always receive a notification if you're mentioned or assigned a topic thread, regardless of whether you've subscribed to notifications on the topic, as long as you have notifications enabled in your [notification preferences](../account/notifications.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must enable notifications in your [notification preferences](../account/notifications.md) to actually receive them. If not, subscribing to notifications on a topic won't do anything!
{% endhint %}

## Step-by-step

### Subscribing to notifications

To subscribe to notifications:

* _While on the topic's page:_ Toggle on the "eye" icon in the upper right corner.
* _While in the workspace:_ Hover over the topic's card, click the ellipsis menu in the corner of the card, and choose _Subscribe to notifications._

When you subscribe to notifications on a topic, you'll receive notifications based on your [notification preferences](../account/notifications.md) just as if you were an owner or collaborator.

### Unsubscribing from notifications

To unsubscribe from notifications:

* _While on the topic's page:_ Toggle off the "eye" icon in the upper right corner.
* _While in the workspace:_ Hover over the topic's card, click the ellipsis menu in the corner of the card, and choose _Unsubscribe from notifications._

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you're a [topic owner or collaborator](ownership.md), you're automatically subscribed to notifications on the topic, and you cannot unsubscribe.
