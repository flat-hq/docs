# Topic descriptions

## Overview

At the center of every topic's page is a real-time, collaborative document. It's the best place to capture the context that people working on the topic will need, both for now and for the future. Things like:

* An overview of what needs to be done
* Why the work is being done in the first place
* Links to resources in other systems

Topic descriptions are entirely optional. After all, sometimes a topic's context is completely clear just from the title!

When you do decide to write a description, you can draft it entirely on your own, or you can collaborate live with your team.

Here are some scenarios where editing in real-time with teammates is helpful:

* **Capturing meeting notes:** Everyone in a meeting can view the topic and watch in real time as the notetaker captures the notes. They can even make corrections themselves.
* **Cross-functional collaboration:** A cross-functional team can collaboratively edit a topic’s description to hammer out a shared understanding of the work to be done from each of their perspectives.
* **Retrospectives:** Using a Flat topic’s description to capture a project’s retrospective is a great way to add to your team’s knowledge base. With collaborative, real-time editing, your team can hash out the retrospective in a joint “jam session”.

## Step-by-step

### Collaborative editing

A topic's description is a fully collaborative, real-time document right out-of-the-box. To edit a topic’s description, just start typing. Multiple users on your team can view and edit a topic's description at the same time, and everyone's edits are synchronized and merged automatically.

### Formatting

#### Formatting toolbar

To access the formatting toolbar, click into the topic's description, then click the formatting icon that appears in the upper right corner of the document.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

The editor recognizes all of the common formatting keyboard shortcuts you'd expect:

* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`B`</mark> to toggle **bold**
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`I`</mark> to toggle _italics_
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Shift`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`X`</mark> to toggle strikethrough
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`E`</mark> to toggle monospace text / code
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Tab`</mark> while in a list item to indent, and <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Shift`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Tab`</mark> while in a list item to dedent
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`K`</mark> to insert a link or make selected text a link
* <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Z`</mark> to undo and <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Ctrl/Cmd`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Shift`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Z`</mark> to redo

#### Markdown

The editor recognizes [basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#basic-syntax) formatting:

* `**text**` for **bold text**
* `*text*` or `_text_` for _italic text_
* `~text~` or `~~text~~` for strikethrough text
* `` `text` `` for monospace text / code
* `#` , `##` , `###` , `####` , `#####` , or `######` at the beginning of a line for headings at different levels
* `>` at the beginning of a line for a block quote
* `-` or `*` at the beginning of a line for a bulleted list
* `1.` at the beginning of a line for a numbered list
* `---` at the beginning of a line for a horizontal divider
* \`\`\` at the beginning of a line, then <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Enter`</mark>, for a code block

### Adding emoji

You can insert emojis by typing  `:` followed by the emoji's name or alias, such as `:+1:` or `:thumbsup:` for :thumbsup:. Or type `:` and a portion of the emoji's name, then select the emoji you want from the dropdown picker.

### Inserting images

To add an image, click the image icon in the toolbar or just drag and drop an image from your computer into the editor area.

### Referencing other topics

You can reference another topic by typing `#` followed by the topic's ID. Or type `#` and a portion of the topic's ID, title, labels, etc., then select the topic from the dropdown picker.
