## Introduction

<details>

<summary>What is a "topic"?</summary>

A topic is just a piece of work to be done. Topics can capture something as quick and simple as “fix homepage typo” or as large and complex as a multinational product launch.

If you're coming to Flat from another tool, you might be familiar with a topic being called a "ticket", "issue", "work item", or "card".

Every topic has its own page in Flat. It's like a lightweight hybrid of a real-time collaborative document, a status-tracking spreadsheet, and a chat room, providing a central gathering place to collect the context and resources related to a piece of work, and to discuss it.

<summary>What is a "workspace"?</summary>

A workspace houses topics going through the same workflow steps and presents the topics visually as a board or list. The steps can be as simple as _To do_ ⇒ _In progress_ ⇒ _Done_, or as many as you like.

Workspaces are great for:

* Separating the work of different teams, to keep clutter to a minimum for everyone.
* Separating work that moves through different workflows.
* Keeping sensitive or confidential topics private to a subset of your organization (via [private workspaces](../workspaces/workspace-visibility.md)).

<summary>How do I edit multiple topics at the same time?</summary>

Flat's _Quick edit_ feature lets you easily make light edits to topics while viewing a workspace. You can launch it using the keyboard shortcut <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`E`</mark> or by holding <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">`Shift`</mark>, then clicking on one or more topics. Then, just type what you want to change in the input box — like a label name, user's name, due date, or anything else — and Flat will offer suggested edits that you can apply.
