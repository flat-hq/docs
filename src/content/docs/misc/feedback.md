# Feedback

Have a suggestion for how we can improve Flat? Whether it's a big idea, a minor quality-of-life improvement, or anything in between, we'd love to hear from you!

There are two ways to get in touch:

* **In the app:** If you're already a Flat user, just click the circled question mark icon in the upper right corner, choose _Share feedback_ and jot down your thoughts. It'll go straight to us.
* **Email:** Whether or not you're already a Flat user, you can always email us at [support@flat.app](mailto:support@flat.app).
